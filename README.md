## Overview  
This project explores an ML pipeline for wine data. The idea is to first predict chemical properties from environmental factors (soil, weather, etc.), and then use those outputs plus brand/region to estimate vintage-level prices.  

The pipeline design and data sources are still in development. Updates will be added as the project progresses.
